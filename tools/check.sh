# failed but a whole step could not run -- no cargo, no git, no jq --

# built, its unit tests -- 178 on 2026-11-12, in support/ and the two
# programs -- rustfmt's verdict, and then every tests/shell/test-*.sh, the
# ones that run a program over the debug build just made rather than
# whatever release build an earlier run left. tools/release.sh runs this
# over a worktree of the commit it is asked to tag, and the release workflow
# runs it at the tag. jayos-bluetooth's tools/check.sh is its model, line
# for line where the two packages agree.

# A 0 is not the whole answer. A suite that runs past a case the machine
# cannot ask -- test-osd.sh's fake Keymapp where python3 is missing --
# says so with a counted `  skip ...` line while exiting 0, because a machine
# without dbus-daemon is not a machine with findings. Looking at the status
# alone, this would end on "ok, nothing to fix", byte for byte what a run that
# asked everything prints. So the skips of a suite that passed are collected
# and named in the summary, and the status is left alone -- jayos's
# install.sh does the same in its skips_within(), for the same reason. The

# exercised" already say more. `^  skip ` with its trailing space, the shape
